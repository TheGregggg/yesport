Kacky is a trackmania competitive which take place every year where the goal is to finish the more maps as possible during one month. The challenge seems easy but it is in fact very difficult. You may be wondering why “kacky”, what does this mean? Spoiler Alert, the trackmania player are very childish and pretty dumb. Kacky comes from German and when translate literally mean crazy, scatty but also and above all : shit, who sucks.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yesport/posts/trackmania/spring-2023/ class="link black dim">Spring 2023 is finally out !</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Banner by Ubisoft
Today, the Saturday first of April, the new Trackmania campaign is online. It’s quite an event, the old games were not updated or very rarely, so there was only one campaign and that forced the players to hunt the same maps again and again. So world records were very close and hard to get but they were pretty prestigious. But it all change with trackmania 2020 , because the game is recent, updates are possible.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yesport/posts/trackmania/what-is-track-mania/ class="link black dim">What is Trackmania</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Banner by Ubisoft
Trackmania is a racing game licence containing 4 games all developped by nadéo and edited by Ubisoft on PC, Playstation 4, Xbox one, Wii and DS. The first Trackmania game was released in 2003. The goal of the game is very simple: drive to the finish the fastest way possible, whatever the way.
The game developer are very lax, they don’t modify (or almost) the game and don’t correct the majority of bugs players find.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yesport/posts/splatoon/splatoon-meta/ class="link black dim">Splatoon 3, and the difficulty of creating a healthy metagame</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction During the 11th to 12 of January, the biggest online tournament of Splatoon 3, the 20XX, held its long-awaited fourth edition.

Friday We got access to the event in advance thanks to Greg and his badge.
The atmosphere was soothing but weird, there was not a lot of players, the lan just opened and there was a lot a empty tables. But it was cool to be with players loving gaming in general and in the CSGO zone, players loving CSGO of course.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yesport/posts/general/women_in_esport/ class="link black dim">Women in E-sport</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I would like to be interested in this chronicle to women in esport.
We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about major international competitions, but these mostly put men in the spotlight, like traditional sports competitions… For example, the broadcast of women’s football represents only 5% of the broadcast football in general.
As in many environments, this is a situation that is changing thanks to the perseverance of many women. They should have as much place as men in esports and play at a professional level.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yesport/posts/smash/intro/ class="link black dim">What is Super Smash Bros.
