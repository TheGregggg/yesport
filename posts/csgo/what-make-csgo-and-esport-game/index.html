How this game keep getting bigger while its getting older ?
We will respond to all of thoses questions but first of all quick explanation of Counter Strike Rules.</p><p><em>Game banner taken from <a href=https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3401926123937881444>CSGO offical site</a></em></p><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Counter Strike is a shooting game. In team of 5 versus 5. To win the game you (and your team) need to win 16 rounds. At the start of the game one team is the Terrorists(T) and the other one is the Counter-Terrorists (CT).
A round lasts 1min and 55sec. The Terrorist team need to plant the bomb and make it explode or kill every anti-terrorists. The CT need to kill all the Terrorists or defuse the bomb if it was planted. The bomb last 40 sec before exploding.
After playing 15 rounds, the teams are swapping sides. The terrorists become CT and so forth.</p><p>Each game is played on a map from competitive map pool. Each map is sligtly different but thay all containt 2 bombsite : A and B. These are the zone where terroristes can plant the bomb, so its the zones to defend as a CT.</p><p>On top of thoses rules there is a economical aspect to manage in a csgo game. You start with 800 dollars and every armor, equipement or weapon cost money. If you buy it, you have it until you die or use it(like grenades). If you didn&rsquo;t die during the next round you doesnt have to rebuy your weapon for exemple. If your team lose the round all the team player gain a money but if your team win the round you gain more. And also depending of your weapon if you kill someone you gain more or less money.</p><p>There is a lot lot of things we didn&rsquo;t explain here but trust me CSGO is very very dense.</p><h2 id=high-skill-cap>High Skill cap</h2><p>What a good transition&mldr; Thats one of the reason CSGO is a fantastic esport game. It&rsquo;s very very dense. It have a very high skill ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also easy for beginner to understand the rules and have fun. Quick to understand, hard to master.
Here is a list of things you can be better at in this game:</p><ul><li>Better map knowledge</li><li>Better cross placement (preaiming to were an oppenenent can be)</li><li>Spray control (each weapon have a spray if you full with is, and you can compensat it to it opponent anyway)</li><li>Team playing and strategies</li><li>Better economical management</li><li>Learn smokes lineup to make on-site execution and blocking comun lineup with smoke grenade</li><li>Learn all of thoses thing fo every map of the map pool</li></ul><p>And when you master everything you also need to learn to adapt to the opponent. And thats the beauty of CSGO, it&rsquo;s an infinite game with endless possibilites. You can see this in the fact thats there is competition on this game for 20 years ! (at the start it was CS 1.6 then CS Source then CSGO).</p><p>And the pro level keep incresing like crazy. There is always new strategies and new thing to try during a game.</p><h2 id=the-community>The community</h2><p>The other thing making this game a esport game is the Community.
The community is fan of the game. They make custom map for tranning specific things. They participate in the online and on site event for the game.
With only good player and no communities behind it a game cant be esport. You need people cheering at events.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also the community in general that engage with the developper to say things about the game thay don&rsquo;t like.</p><p>And as our last point, the community can be the start of competition for some. In the beginner leagues, everythings is managed by passionates of tha game. It can be the <a href=https://thegregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/csgo/insalan-ptits-cochons/>Insalan</a> for exemple or online tournament that append literraly every minutes of the day. You can create your own team (like Ptits Cochons) and go in tournament to make a name for yourself !
And thats incredible</p><h2 id=baked-by-valve>Baked by Valve</h2><p>And finaly the point that make it a Very Very Big esport title.
The Developper of the game, Valve, is not against the esportnes of CSGO and instead embrace it. They make very little game braking update so the game stay competitive. They put money of the biggest CSGO Event twice a year : the CSGO Major (and the next one happen in Paris).
Thank to them, their is one event who is bigger than all the other. And also a very big event in all esports game.
Thoses big events are why people play the games and watch pro matches and also why pro love to compete. All the team prepare so much for just the Major.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Here they is our trinity for why CSGO is an esport title:
High skill cap, Incredible community and Developper supports.</p><p>Hope we hype you about this incredible game.
You can watch CSGO current and next big tournament on <a href=htlv.org>htlv.org</a>
they are the go to site to know everything about csgo esport.
