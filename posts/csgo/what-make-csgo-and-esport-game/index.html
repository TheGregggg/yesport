How this game keeps getting bigger while its getting older ?
We will respond to all of thoses questions but first of all quick explanation of Counter Strike Rules.</p><p><em>Game banner taken from <a href=https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3401926123937881444>CSGO offical site</a></em></p><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Counter Strike is a shooting game in teams of 5 versus 5. To win the game you (and your team) need to win 16 rounds. At the beginning of the game one team is the Terrorists(T) and the other one is the Counter-Terrorists (CT).
A round lasts 1min and 55sec. The Terrorist team needs to plant the bomb and make it explode or kill every anti-terrorists. The CT need to kill all the Terrorists or defuse the bomb if it was planted. The bomb lasts 40 sec before exploding.
After playing 15 rounds, the teams are swapping sides. The terrorists become CT and so forth.</p><p>Each game is played on a map from competitive map pool. Each map is sligtly different but they all containt 2 bombsites : A and B. These are the zones where terrorists can plant the bomb, so they are the zones to defend as a CT.</p><p>On top of thoses rules there is an economical aspect to manage in a csgo game. You start with 800 dollars and every armor, equipement or weapon cost money. If you buy it, you have it until you die or use it(like grenades). If you didn&rsquo;t die during the next round you don&rsquo;t have to rebuy your weapon fas an example. If your team loses the round all the team players gain a money but if your team wins the round you gain more. And also depending on your weapon if you kill someone you gain more or less money.</p><p>There is a lot of things we didn&rsquo;t explain here but trust me CSGO is full of subtilities.</p><h2 id=high-skill-cap>High Skill cap</h2><p>What a good transition&mldr; That&rsquo;s one of the reasons CSGO is a fantastic esport game. It&rsquo;s very very dense. It have a very high skill ceiling. But it&rsquo;s also easy for beginners to understand the rules and have fun. Quick to understand, hard to master.
Here is a list of things you may improve in this game:</p><ul><li>Better map knowledge</li><li>Better cross placement (preaiming to were an oppenent can be)</li><li>Spray control (each weapon has a bullet patern if you keep shooting, and you can compensate it to hit opponent anyway)</li><li>Team playing and strategies</li><li>Better economical management</li><li>Learn smokes lineup to make on-site execution and blocking commun lineup with smoke grenades</li><li>Learn all of those things for every map of the map pool</li></ul><p>And when you master everything you also need to learn to adapt to the opponent. And thats the beauty of CSGO, it&rsquo;s an infinite game with endless possibilites. You can see this in the fact that there has been competitions on this game for 20 years ! (at the start it was CS 1.6 then CS Source then CSGO).</p><p>And the pro level keeps increasing like crazy. There is always new strategies and new things to try during a game.</p><h2 id=the-community>The community</h2><p>The other thing making this game a esport game is the Community.
The community is fan of the game. They make custom map for training specific things. They participate in the online and on site event for the game.
With only good players and no communities behind it, a game can&rsquo;t be esport. You need people cheering up at events.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also the community in general that engage with the developpers to say things about the game they don&rsquo;t like.</p><p>And as our last point, the community can be the start of competition for some. In the beginners leagues, everything is managed by passionates of the game. It can be the <a href=https://thegregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/csgo/insalan-ptits-cochons/>Insalan</a> for example or online tournament that happens litterally every minutes of the day. You can create your own team (like Ptits Cochons) and go in tournament to make a name for yourself !
And thats incredible</p><h2 id=baked-by-valve>Baked by Valve</h2><p>And finally the point that makes it a Very Very Big esport title.
The Developper of the game, Valve, is not against the esportness of CSGO and instead embraces it. They make very little game braking update so the game stay competitive. They put money of the biggest CSGO Event twice a year : the CSGO Major (and the next one happens in Paris).
Thank to them, their is one event who is bigger than all the other. And also a very big event in all esports game.
Thoses big events are why people play the games and watch pro matchs and also why pro love to compete. All the teams prepare so much for just the Major.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Here there is our trinity for why CSGO is an esport title:
High skill cap, Incredible community and Developper supports.</p><p>Hope we hype you about this incredible game.
You can watch CSGO current and next big tournament on <a href=htlv.org>htlv.org</a>
they are the go to site to know everything about csgo esport.
