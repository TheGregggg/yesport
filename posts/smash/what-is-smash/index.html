Each character has different moves (All the possible moves in SSBU), they use to increase the percentage meter of their enemies. The higher a percentage of a character is, the farther they will be knocked out by attack, making it easier for them to be pushed off the stage.</p><p><img src=/yesport/images/pikachu.jpg alt="A screenshot of a game">
