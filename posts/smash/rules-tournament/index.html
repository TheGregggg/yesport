All of the items introduced random elements and that&rsquo;s something that is horrendous for competitive play. The randomness of the items come even from how they appeared on the map : You have no way of knowing which items will spawn. Another element of randomness in the objects, is the fact that for a same object they can have different effects, that you can’t guess, like the pokeball which are all the same but have a lot of pokemons who can be spawned by them.</p><p>For the victory conditions, this is the stock one who is used. So each player has three lifes, and a maximum time for a match of seven minutes. All of the others classic setting of the games are the default one, apart from the one concerning the stages :</p><h1 id=stages-rules->Stage’s rules :</h1><p>In competitive play, there are a lot of stages which are simply not allowed. The allowed stages are differents for each tournaments but there is some who are almost universally allowed :</p><ul><li>Battlefield</li><li>Final Destination</li><li>Pokémon Stadium 2</li><li>Smashville</li></ul><p>Another important setting is the stage hazard. Stage hazards are what are called the special effects of some stages. An example is on Pokemon Stadium 2, who randomly change between four versions (Electric, Ground, Flying, Ice) related to pokemon types.</p><p><img src=/yesport/images/nantes-smash.png alt="Example of stages used in tournaments at Nantes">
<em>Example of stages used in tournaments at Nantes</em></p><h2 id=other-rules-in-competitive-play>Other rules in competitive play</h2><p>The previous rules are defined in the game itself but there are also rules which are just inherent to the tournaments in itself. Note : These rules are not universal but there are classic ones in tournaments.</p><p>To begin with, the tournaments work with a bracket with double elimination. This means that when you lose your first match, you are sent into the losers bracket. And if you lose in the losers brackets then you are out of the tournaments. If you manage to win all of your matches in the losers brackets, you will face the winners of the winners brackets, so a player who has not lost a single match of the tournaments. And the winners of this match are the winners of the tournaments.</p><p><img src=/yesport/images/bracket.png alt="Double elimination brackets with 8 teams">
<em>An example of a double elimination brackets with 8 teams from <a href=https://baseball.tools/8-team-double-elimination-bracket/>https://baseball.tools/8-team-double-elimination-bracket/</a></em></p><p>For the match in itself, they are often played in BO3 (Best Of 3), and with final matches in BO5 (Best Of 5). This means that each match consists of at least 2 games. In BO3, the first players who get two victories, win the match. And in BO5, this is the first player who gets to three victories who won the match.</p><p>All of these rules are there to ensure that every match are the least random possible, and that even if the best players can lose à game, he will get the victory in the others ones, and will ultimately win the match, and the tournaments.
