The button is used to determine the type of attacks, which we will talk about a bit later on. The joystick determines which attack of this type will be used and there are four possibilities.</p><ul><li>Neutral, with no inputs of the joystick .</li><li>Side , with the joystick put to the left or right</li><li>Up, with the joystick put to the top</li><li>Down, with the joystick put to the bottom
From there, I will call each attack with the direction and the type, like down B. for example. And about the types, let’s get to the first one : Special Attacks</li></ul><h2 id=special-attacks->Special Attacks :</h2><p>Used by pressing the B button, Special Attack can be quite powerful but more importantly, like its name says : it has special effects. This effect can be very diversified , and they are almost all different depending on the character. For example : the Neutral B (Special attack with direction + B) of Sephiroth is an explosion that can be charged through three stages, each of them decreasing the range, which it will be launched but increasing the power of the explosion.
The Up B is also very important because it allows you to come back on the, but we will talk about it in a specific guide. Although the special attacks are different for each character, some of them share similarities, like many swordsmen have a counter attack, which will reflect damages dealt by their opponents.But let&rsquo;s get to the next types of attack : Smash Attacks.</p><h2 id=smash-attacks->Smash Attacks :</h2><p>Smash Attacks are extremely powerful attacks, who can be charged, but they are very slow and leave you vulnerable while you are doing it. They. are often used to kill your opponent due to the massive knockback they inflict.
With the defants controller settings, they can be made used from two differents inputs :
The right joystick, called the C-Stick, in reference to the gamecube controller, with the direction of it working the same way as the left joystick, or by pressing À + B simultaneously.
And that’s all for part one of this guide, the remaining types will be explained in the second part, coming soon.
