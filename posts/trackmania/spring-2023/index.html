Today, the Saturday first of April, the new Trackmania campaign is online. It’s quite an event, the old games were not updated or very rarely, so there was only one campaign and that forced the players to hunt the same maps again and again. So world records were very close and hard to get but they were pretty prestigious. But it all change with trackmania 2020 , because the game is recent, updates are possible."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.111.3"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/yesport/ananke/css/main.min.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/yesport/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Spring 2023 is finally out !"><meta property="og:description" content="Banner by Ubisoft

It’s quite an event, the old games were not updated or very rarely, so there was only one campaign and that forced the players to hunt the same maps again and again. So world records were very close and hard to get but they were pretty prestigious. But it all change with trackmania 2020 , because the game is recent, updates are possible. So campaign can roll every 3 month ( the fisrt of the month after a change of season. Campaigns are divided into 5 categories according to their difficulties like skiing: from easiest to hardest: white, green, blue, red and black. What’s interesting about theses campaigns is that the records are updated in real time in game and are easy to visualize which make the game even more competitive. Moreover, all the shots are allowed: shortcuts, bugs… Even if it happens that people cheat to attain the top of the leaderboards. Records are very prestigious because a lot of people plays on these maps. Furthermore, records are very close, some are few thousands of a second away and there has already been cases of tie. It’s very impressive to see the improvement of the records as the season progresses: between the records drove in the first week and the finals one (yes, the records are sealed up when the season end) there are often whole seconds. If you don’t when to compare yourself with other peoples, you can try to obtain medals on all the maps of the campaigns. There are 4 types of medals from the easiest to the hardest : bronze, silver, gold and author. Author medal is the hardest one because to obtain it you have to beat the time of the creator of the map.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"><div id=commento></div><script defer src=https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js></script></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/>&copy; Yesport 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
