The challenge seems easy but it is in fact very difficult. You may be wondering why “kacky”, what does this mean? Spoiler Alert, the trackmania player are very childish and pretty dumb. Kacky comes from German and when translate literally mean crazy, scatty but also and above all : shit, who sucks. So we can translate Kackiest Kacky by the worst shit. Kacky maps aren’t made to be clean, nice to drive but very difficult, so difficult that the players feel challenged so they spend a little too much time on them. Well, the main goal of these maps isn’t to drive the fastest time but just finish the map. Maps are very short but very very very difficult. They required a lot of luck and talent to finish. Each map is unique because they use different bugs, different feature, are luck based or skill based.
So, kakiest kacky is an annual event sponsored in order to reward those who finished more of the 70 maps.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"><div id=commento></div><script defer src=https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js></script></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/>&copy; Yesport 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
