They should have as much place as men in esports and play at a professional level.</p><p>Some big organizations are starting to highlight women&rsquo;s teams on games like league of legend or Valorant. For example G2 esport has a team called G2 Hel which includes 5 female professional league of legend players. There is also a French player under the nickname ColombLBL.</p><p>In fact, in the esport, it is quite particular because there is no notion of physical difference between men and women. The main competitions should then be supposed to be mixed. There are exclusively female competitions but these are not known at all because they are not highlighted.</p><p>Thus, to use the example of G2 Hel again, it is a team that tries to access the main competitions by winning increasingly important tournaments as would other teams usually do.</p><p><img src=/yesport/images/G2-hel.jpg alt="G2 Hel team"></p><p>G2 Hel is currently participating to a competition called division 2. This is the competition that comes before the national league. After the national league, it is the LEC, the European championship, that allows access to the world championships.</p><p>This is only one example of integration of women in esport but it is something that
finally emerges in many games. This is very positive even if it remains too slow, the
notion of equality between men and women should already be fully integrated in all
areas of society.</p><h2 id=sources>Sources</h2><ul><li>G2 Hel banner : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/G2esports/photos/a.487011288070323/5264956000275804/?type=3">G2&rsquo;s Facebook</a></li><li>G2 Hel image : <a href=https://riftfeed.gg/esports/g2-hel-wins-the-rising-stars-tournament>riftfeed.gg</a></li><li><a href=https://g2esports.com/blogs/teams/hel>https://g2esports.com/blogs/teams/hel</a></li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"><div id=commento></div><script defer src=https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js></script></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/>&copy; Yesport 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
