We&amp;rsquo;ve talked a lot about major international competitions, but these mostly put men in the spotlight, like traditional sports competitions… For example, the broadcast of women’s football represents only 5% of the broadcast football in general.
As in many environments, this is a situation that is changing thanks to the perseverance of many women. They should have as much place as men in esports and play at a professional level.</description></item></channel></rss>
