Friday We got access to the event in advance thanks to Greg and his badge.
The ambience was soothing but weird, there was not a lot of player, the lan just opened and there was a lot a empty table. But it was cool to be with player loving gaming in general and in the CSGO zone, player loving csgo of course.</description></item><item><title>State of the French CSGO Scene in 2023</title><link>https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/csgo/french-csgo-state-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 18:57:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/csgo/french-csgo-state-2023/</guid><description>Counter Strike is more alive than ever in France.
