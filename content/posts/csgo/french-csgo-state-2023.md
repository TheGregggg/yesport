## The Major

Obviously, this year is the year of the Major. The CSGO Major, taking place in Paris and hosted by Blast.tv at the Accor Arena.
It will be fantastic and incredible.

For the ones who don't know what a major is : it's the biggest and most anticipated tournament of the game. It's the only tournament baked by Valve (the CSGO developers)
and there is $1,250,000 of prizepool witch is ENORMOUS.

France will be the showcase of the best cs for everyone. As a French guy, it makes me happy to know everyone will look at your country because it's hosting the biggest event of the game.
It's also the first time the Major will happen in France.

## States of the leagues

The only league level competition is the ESL Championat National (ECN). It occurs twice a year since 2016. 8 Team were fighting for victory in this league.

This year, it's 10 teams competing in the 2023 Spring edition ! The qualifier for getting access to the only 2 places avalaible is already done.
All the big French teams are here : Falcons, Heet, LDLC, GenOne.
We have currently no information for the start of the season.
Stay tuned to Yesport to know when its coming !

## What are the major tournaments this year ?

As always, the French scene is pretty full of lan party all over the country.

In February there was the Insalan XVII, which contains 24 teams competing in 2 brackets, the amature and elite brackets.
The amature bracket contains 16 teams and the elite bracket contains the 8 best teams from the groupes matches.

La Coupe organised by KRL is already at its third apparition. Unfortunatly, there is no information currently to whether or not it will come back. We obviously hope so and will tell you when we know it.

The Nantarena annonced recently they will organised just one tournament this year. They didn't announced a precise date but time will tell us. It's a very cool tournament and it's organised at Polytech Nantes !

## How well are French teams going

Vitality, the best French team, is going strong from the start of 2023. apEX said in a interview from Vice that they weren't sleeping enough in the end of 2022 and that they will make less tournament to be better. And we just saw a very good start with solids wins during qualifiers. They even managed to get in playoffs of IEM Katowice 2023 despite losing right after.

Vitality is the only tier one team with French player.

Despite that, there is a lot of French team in French CSGO that are interesting to look at.
LDLC, GenOne, Heet and Falcons are really cool and will be competing in the ECN very soon.
There will be some spectacles !

## Global state in France

_What a year to be lived for the Frenchy._

Combining the usual tournaments, teams, the ECN league and the upcoming Blast.tv Paris Major, CSGO in France as to deliver. You should be a happy if you are a French loving CSGO this year !
