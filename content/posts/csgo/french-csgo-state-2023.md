## The Major

Obviously, this year is the year of the Major. The CSGO Major, taking place in Paris and hosted by Blast.tv at the Accor Arena.
It will be fantastic and incredible.

For the ones who don't know what a major is : it's the biggest and most anticipated tournament of the game. It's the only tournament baked by Valve (the CSGO developers)
and there is $1,250,000 of prizepool witch is ENORMOUS.

France will be the showcase of the best cs for everyone. As a French guy, it make me happy to know everyone will look a your contry because it's hosting the biggest event of the game.
It's also the first time the Major will happen in France.

## States of the leagues

The only league level competition is the ESL Championat National (ECN). It occur twice a year since 2016. 8 Team were fating for victory in this league.

## Whats are the major tournaments this year ?

As always, the french scene is pretty full of lan party all over the country.

## How well are french teams going

Vitality, the best french team, is going strong from the start of 2023. apEX said in a interview from Vice that they weren't sleeping enough and that they will make less tournament to be better. And we just saw a very good start with solid win during qualifiers. They even managed to get in playoffs of IEM Katowice 2023 despite losing right after.

Vitality is the only tier one team with french player.
