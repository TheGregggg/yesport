## Friday

We got access to the event in advance thanks to Greg and his badge.

The ambience was soothing but weird, there was not a lot of player, the lan just opened and there was a lot a empty table. But it was cool to be with player loving gaming in general and in the CSGO zone, player loving csgo of course.

After the players of Ptits Cochons installed there computers, they were playing like crazy ! They told us that they didn't manage to playe together before the lan ! What a scoop !

At 1AM, they were starting to shutdown the gamings PCs . They got invited in a friend house in Renne to sleep, "it was cool" as they said.

## Saturday

The day begin with the start of the tournament at 10AM.
The first thing we saw when everyone arrive is that it was way more full of people than friday night. There was a lot of people and a lot of computer !
'It was incredible' said Gregggg next to us.
The Ptits cochon player came at 9AM so they were ready to perfoms.

The first match was against ROTATE on the map Inferno. It was an easy game fot the team with a solid 16 to 5 score at the end. And one win for Ptits Cochons !
The team was happy for the win even though ROTATE wasn't very strong.

The second match came in at 12AM. It was against Dynas Black on inferno again. This match was special because initialy, one of the member of dynas black should have play in ptits cochons team. But the Dynas need him as he said. So I was the occasion to prove him wrong and destroy him in this game. And they did ! Ptits cochons won 16 to 9 !
Two games and two wins so far !

At this time it was 1PM and it was the lunch pause. They ate  
cheese ham sandwiches like !

After eating, it was time to compete again and the third match began immediately. Ptits cochon were playing against KAMIKAZE. on the map Anubis It was a hard game for the team and they lose with an hard 1 to 16 score. They were very strong.

They continue with a match against Grand Chelem, the tournament favorite ! The player were excited to play against them. The match was played on Ancient. And once again the team lose the game, sadly. It was more close than the last one with a final score of 9 round to 16. The players where happy of their performances.

The last game of the groupes matches was against MAISON2RETRAITE on Inferno again. The player were rstarting to get tired of playing since 10AM. Ptits Cochons lose 10 to 16. They didn't played well this game.

Ptits cochons finished the 5 groupes matches with 2 win and 3 loses. Not bad for a first time for some of the Ptits chochons player like TomyJ and Gregggg.
The team is now in the amature bracket.

Shorlty after, Ptits cochons played against ROTATE again on Mirage. The match was close at the beginning until Ptits Cochons understand their oponents and destroyed them. They win with 16 rounds to 7.
With this Ptits Cochon goes to semi-finals !

It was starting to get late but another match needed to be played. At 1AM of Sunday, Ptits cochon compete against COOL AND THE GANG for a place to finals ! They were playing on Inferno. Unfortunalty, they lose 5 rounds to 16.
The players were exhausted for this first day but they were not out yet !
When you lose you go to the looser bracket and if you win every matches you can go to final ! So they just need to win 3 matches to go into finals !

The players go back to their freind house to have a good sleep for the last day of the LAN.

## Sunday

The next day, the matches started at 11AM.

Ptits Cochons played against LES ZINZINS DE L'ESPACE. If they lose there out, if they win they can stay in the looser bracket.

And after 40min of hard competition. Ptits cochons lose and is out of the tournament. They lose 4 rounds to 16 on Inferno.
They finish the tournament in sem-finals wich is pretty good even thought its in the armature bracket.

The player were sad because of the lose but they were happy for the incredible weekend they just lived together.
