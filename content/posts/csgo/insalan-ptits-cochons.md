Yesport was invited to cover Ptits Cochons esport team in their trip to the 'Insalan' of February 2023 !

## Friday

We got access to the event in advance thanks to Greg and his badge.

The atmosphere was soothing but weird, there was not a lot of players, the lan just opened and there was a lot a empty tables. But it was cool to be with players loving gaming in general and in the CSGO zone, players loving CSGO of course.

After the players of Ptits Cochons installed their computers, they were playing like crazy ! They told us that they didn't manage to play together before the lan ! What a scoop !

At 1AM, they were starting to turn off the gamings PCs . They got invited to a friend house in Renne to sleep, "it was cool" as they said.

## Saturday

The day began with the start of the tournament at 10AM.
The first thing we saw when everyone arrive is that it was way more full of people than friday night. There was a lot of people and a lot of computers !
'It was incredible' said Gregggg next to us.
The Ptits Cochons players came at 9AM so they were ready to perform.

The first match was against ROTATE on the map Inferno. It was an easy game for the team with a solid 16 to 5 score at the end. And one win for Ptits Cochons !
The team was happy for the win even though ROTATE wasn't very strong.

The second match came in at 12AM. It was against Dynas Black on inferno again. This match was special because initially, one of thedynas black's member should have played in Ptits Cochons team. But the Dynas needed him as he said. So it was the occasion to prove him wrong and destroy him in this game. And they did ! Ptits Cochons won 16 to 9 !
Two games and two wins so far !

At this time it was 1PM and it was the lunch break. They ate  
cheese ham sandwiches like pigs !

After eating, it was time to compete again and the third match began immediately. Ptits Cochons were playing against KAMIKAZE, on the map Anubis. It was a hard game for the team and they lost with a hard 1 to 16 score. They were very strong.

They continue with a match against Grand Chelem, the tournament favorite ! The players were excited to play against them. The match was played on Ancient. And once again the team lost the game, sadly. It was more close than the last one with a final score of 9 round to 16. The players were happy with their performances.

The last game of the teams matchs was against MAISON2RETRAITE on Inferno again. The players were starting to get tired of playing as they started at 10AM. Ptits Cochons lost 10 to 16. They didn't played well on this game.

Ptits Cochons finished the 5 groupes matchs with 2 wins and 3 loses. Not bad for a first time for some of the Ptits chochons players like TomyJ and Gregggg.
The team is now in the amature bracket.

After the diner pause, the bracket began immediatly and they first played against the Dynas Red, an other team from the Dynas groupes. They played on Vertigo. And the team started strong the bracket with a solid win with 16 to 4 as the final score ! GG Ptits Cochons.
With this win Ptits Cochons goes to the quarter-final of the armature bracket !

Shorlty after, Ptits Cochons played against ROTATE again on Mirage. Scores were close at the beginning until Ptits Cochons understood their oponents and destroyed them. They won with 16 rounds to 7.
With this, Ptits Cochons goes to semi-finals !

It was starting to get late but another match needed to be played. At 1AM of Sunday, Ptits Cochons compete against COOL AND THE GANG for a place to finals ! They were playing on Inferno. Unfortunatly, they lost 5 rounds to 16.
The players were exhausted for this first day but they were not out yet !
When you lose you go to the looser bracket and if you win every matchs you can go to final ! So they just need to win 3 matchs to go into finals !

The players go back to their friend house to have a good sleep for the last day of the LAN.

## Sunday

The next day, the matchs started at 11AM.

Ptits Cochons played against LES ZINZINS DE L'ESPACE. If they lose, they're out, nevertheless, if they win they can stay in the looser bracket.

And after 40min of hard competition, Ptits Cochons members lost and are out of the tournament. They lost 4 rounds to 16 on Inferno.
They finished the tournament in semi-finals wich is pretty good even though it is in the armature bracket.

The players were sad because of the lose but they were happy for the incredible weekend they just lived together.
