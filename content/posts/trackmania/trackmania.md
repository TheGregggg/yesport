For those who don’t know, the season 2023 of the Trackmania Grand League(TMGL for short) will start
tommorow. Don’t miss it. For the sleepy head at the bakc of the classroom, i will resume what it is.

The TMGL is a trackmania tournament where 8 teams of 2 players compete.

Those player comes from around the world but, this year, 31 % of players are french.

The canadian player CarlJr will be present, if you don’t know him, he is arguably the best player of the
world, he is the magnus karlsen or the michael jordan of trackamania, he already won 6 world champion
title.

The teams are very interesting, there are rivalties, different personnailities, young prodigies, veterans, I
can’t wait to see what’s going to happend.

So, the tournament will proceed like this :

There are 3 phases in the competition : The qualifiers from 21th of january to 26th of february to
determine the last two team who are gonna be eliminated from the tournament.
The play offs : from 12th to 19th of march and finally the all stars from 16th to 22th of april.

How are the match going to happend :

The matches are going to be 1 team against another.
First one to 10 points win the round and first team to 4 round wins.

But how the points are gonna be counted ?

If a team make an ace ( if the two player are first and second) : its 3 points for the team and 0 to the other
one.
If a team wins a round : 2 point for that team and 1 to the other one
And if its a tie (the first is with the fourth) : both team earn a point.

On which map are the match going to be competed on ?

A selection of 10 map, made for the occasion by very talented mappers with different style, different
identity (an identity is a very unique and risky part of the track).
They had to learn the maps, this mean learn the lines to optimise the trajectory and find potential shortcut.
This is very interesting because, there are many different tactics, teams don’t have the same strategy and
lines. This lead to epics races where teams are forced to play risky to catch up to there opponents.

So, in the end, don’t miss the TMGL cause it’s a very hype game
