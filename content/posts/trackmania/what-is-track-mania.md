Trackmania is a racing game licence containing 4 games all developped by nadéo and edited by Ubisoft on PC, Playstation 4, Xbox one, Wii and DS. The first Trackmania game was released in 2003.
The goal of the game is very simple: drive to the finish the fastest way possible, whatever the way.

The game developer are very lax, they don’t modify (or almost) the game and don’t correct the majority of bugs players find. Yes, the ‘bugs’ are truly a part of the game to a certain extent where they are not called bugs anymore but features or ‘tricks’. They exist in a multitude of form, some can give you few miles per hour when wiggling at the wright timing, others will allow you to make a sharp turn without losing the slightest speed or, for the more trickier but more rewarding tou can gain hundreds of speed in a fraction of a second. Just to say, only one bug has been remove by the game developer: on an old game, if you drove backward, you were gaining more speed than by going forward.

Trackmania isn’t a normal racing game either, it exist blocks who gives effects when driven on like the boost, the free wheeling and even reactors. Techniques also exist like the drifts, speed-drift and, more importantly the cuts. Cuts are a very big thing in the Trackmania games because the game is very free, players can climb over the walls to escape the intended ways, they can jump to a whole other section of the map. Cuts for the most clueless among you is the short of shortcuts that is when the players leave the ways the mapper though about.

In these blog, we are going to talk mostly about the last game in date, the game soberly named “Trackmania” but called by the community Trackmania 2020 because it was released in 2020.
In this game many new things: new surface like the slippery ice or the bouncy plastic and the last but not the least the water but also new effects blocks like the slow-mo, the speed regulator, the no steering or the reactors.

So, maps can be sort in many categories according the type of surface or the type of driving.
So there are ice maps, bobsleigh maps, tech maps ( tech is the contraption of technical), lol maps (where the luck is involved) … There is more than 70000 maps built on Trackmania 2020 and put on the site tmx where all the mapper put their maps.

Being the latest in date, it’s on this one that the community is more active. And, it’s possibly on this game that the players are more competitive on. And for a good reason, each trimester, a new official campaign is released, but that, that is an other story.
