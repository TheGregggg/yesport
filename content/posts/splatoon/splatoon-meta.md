## Introduction

During the 11th to 12 of January, the biggest online tournament of Splatoon 3, the 20XX, held its long-awaited fourth edition. The last one having reunited 128 teams from across the globe for a tremendous cash prize of $0USD.

This community event highlights that despite a lack of real support from the game editor, Nintendo, the Splatoon competitive community continues to strive forward since the first iteration of the franchise, back in 2015.
That may be one of Splatoon's strong points, the uniqueness of its gameplay and playstyles offered by a wide variety of weapons.
That is the reason players had kept coming back to the game, wanting more.

But let's get back to the "20XX", taking place during the second day the grand final opposed a Japanese versus a North America team, as for the weapons they chose, out of 8 players, 5 picked the Splash-o-Matic.

How come that a game so centered around the diversity of its playstyles did end up being so restrictive at high level ? In this article, we're going to dive deep into the analysis of the metagame of Splatoon, and how Nintendo has yet to reach a healthy balance for its competitive player base.

## Back in 2015

Let's go back to where it all started, May 2015, the release of Splatoon, a 4V4 shooting game, where your character switches back and forth between a squid and a humanoid form, similarly to Darwin's evolution theory.

This game represents Nintendo's take on modern shooting games : the simplification of its mechanics (reload, space control, sneaking…) by merging them into one core concept : being able to ink spaces with your weapon and swim in your team's ink.

The first game was quite experimental, with a development cycle focused on adding regularly new content, the game had yet to reach any form of balance with some special weapons being overpowered.

The second game was released in June 2017 as part of the starter catalog of Nintendo's new console : the Nintendo Switch. As such, the game was developed on quite a short notice, and came out only a year after Splatoon 1 stopped receiving content updates.

Apart from a general improvement of the game mechanics, with this sequel, the developers tried to fix some of the first game issues by replacing the specials weapons by weaker ones to force team coordination, which at high level ended up damaging the overall pacing of the game.

## Splatoon 3 at the pinnacle of the franchise

As for the third installation of the series, a lot of progress was made and ones that particularly affected the competitive player base. Firstly by combining the best elements of the first two games in the new special moves designs, secondly, by offering in-game tools such as free map explorations, match replays, or a massive training room for players to improve with the game's mechanics.

Those changes really emphasize how Nintendo has been taking inspiration from the format of competitive shooter, not by simply adding popular features from other games, but by dissecting what it brings to the overall experience in order to better suit the game needs.

The example that best illustrates this is probably the battle pass. In most online shooters, it acts as a paying system that rewards players with cosmetics based on their in- game performances. This system normally functions as a return on investment, offering better reward than the in-game shop in exchange for the player's regularity. As such, it helps the game maintain a regular base of player, which is essential for service games to assure consistent revenues.

Splatoon 3 isn't a service game, it's a full $60 game that doesn't have any kind of online shop, all its cosmetics and weapons are unlockable just by playing normally, and as such his battle pass is free.

In this context, this system acts more as a way to encourage players to come back to unlock seasonal cosmetics, but without forcing them to make their money worth it, like with the previous examples. This and other quality of life improvement really helped in creating a healthy environment for the competitive scene to develop around the game.

## The core problem, map design

So let's dive into the main issue of Splatoon’s 3, it’s map design, to find out from where the issues arise let’s first define what makes for a good Splatoon map. We can narrow it to those global two criteria

1. The layout make for interesting ways to navigate within it

2. Maps shouldn't give unfair advantages for specifics types of weapons

As for the first criteria, map design should aim for the right balance, without overcomplicated structure nor plain parts (this is especially important in an action packed game like Splatoon), as well as making full use of the game's large movement palette.

This criteria is arguably met in the vast majority of the game maps, the second one, however, raises more concern.

The reason as to why some weapons have the upper hand on others originate from how the maps are structured. To illustrate my saying, I'll be using a top-down view of a fan favorite map among casual and more competitive players, MakoMart.

## Flank VS key position

_Promotional screen of “Makomart”, a returning map from Splatoon 2_

This concept is the key to apprehend the power dynamic between the different weapons available is how each gets value in different types of positions. And by extension, how the player needs to position themselves where their weapon is at their most effective range / angles.

For example, long range weapons benefit the most from high up spots that offer them a broader view on the battlefield, in this position they can control more space by threatening to kill everyone that comes into their area of effect. (Which is especially important in a game where the objective always depends on space control)

![Example of the “splatter scope”, a long range weapon, effective range (in green), which in this position, cover a very large portion of the front line](/yesport/images/splatoon/12.jpg)
_Example of the “splatter scope”, a long range weapon, effective range (in green), which in this position, cover a very large portion of the front line_

As such, the advantages that come with controlling those key positions for long range weapons must come in pair with the difficulty of holding them.

That's where covers and flanks routes come in, allowing weapons with shorter area of effects to come closer, where they often gain an advantage over those long range weapons.

![In red the flanks routes and circled in blue the principals covers, that a short range weapon can use to approach a long ranged weapon](/yesport/images/splatoon/13.jpg)
_In red the flanks routes and circled in blue the principals covers, that a short range weapon can use to approach a long ranged weapon_

What makes those flanks routes reliable against long range weapons come from the inability for those to monitor every angle that a player could arrive from.

This power dynamic, if balanced properly, creates an interesting relationship as the short range has to respect the opponent's range while the other has to respect his opponent's movement capability, which allows for a variety of mind games and possible strategy (sneaking, baiting, etc…).

## The crab Metagame

![Promotional screen of one of Splatoon 3 most criticized map “Eeltail allay”](/yesport/images/splatoon/14.jpg)

What those maps really suffer from is the lack of flanks routes and the interesting angles offered as counter to those key positions. This situation is symptomatic to maps such as Hammerhead bridge or Eeltail allay, built around narrow middle ground offering few if any options for getting around the opposing team.

Now imagine adding to that a long range special weapon able to easily hold one key thanks to a momentary boost of health point, and you get yourself in a situation where the Crab Tank absolutely dominates Splatoon 3 metagame.

And there you have it, the reason for why at the 20XX 5 out of 8 were using this special weapon among the 15 available, the crab tank is just that powerful when it comes to controlling narrow and flat areas which is the bread and butter of this third installation.

To be fair, this issue concerning maps is not an isolated case, and was present even back in Splatoon 2. If the design idea behind it strives to simplify its map design, further enhancing the title accessibility and beginner-friendly aspect, this aspect ends up directly conflicting with the overall balance of the game from a competitive standpoint.
