There are two ways to play the game : You can play in a solo campaign called World Of Light, or you can fight freely against other players or AI.

## The basics of the gameplay :

Each match can make fights up to eight characters, on different stages, where they must try to knock each other out of the stage. Each character has different moves (All the possible moves in SSBU), they use to increase the percentage meter of their enemies. The higher a percentage of a character is, the farther they will be knocked out by attack, making it easier for them to be pushed off the stage.
