I would like to be interested in this chronicle to women in esport.

We've talked a lot about major international competitions, but these mostly put men in the spotlight, like traditional sports competitions… For example, the broadcast of women’s football represents only 5% of the broadcast football in general.

As in many environments, this is a situation that is changing thanks to the perseverance of many women. They should have as much place as men in esports and play at a professional level.

Some big organizations are starting to highlight women's teams on games like league of legend or Valorant. For example G2 esport has a team called G2 Hel which includes 5 female professional league of legend players. There is also a French player under the nickname ColombLBL.

In fact, in the esport, it is quite particular because there is no notion of physical difference between men and women. The main competitions should then be supposed to be mixed. There are exclusively female competitions but these are not known at all because they are not highlighted.

Thus, to use the example of G2 Hel again, it is a team that tries to access the main competitions by winning increasingly important tournaments as would other teams usually do.

G2 Hel is currently participating to a competition called division 2. This is the competition that comes before the national league. After the national league, it is the LEC, the European championship, that allows access to the world championships.
