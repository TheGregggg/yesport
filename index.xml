Friday We got access to the event in advance thanks to Greg and his badge.
The atmosphere was soothing but weird, there was not a lot of players, the lan just opened and there was a lot a empty tables. But it was cool to be with players loving gaming in general and in the CSGO zone, players loving CSGO of course.</description></item><item><title>Women in E-sport</title><link>https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/general/women_in_esport/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 13:18:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://TheGregggg.github.io/yesport/posts/general/women_in_esport/</guid><description>I would like to be interested in this chronicle to women in esport.
We&amp;rsquo;ve talked a lot about major international competitions, but these mostly put men in the spotlight, like traditional sports competitions… For example, the broadcast of women’s football represents only 5% of the broadcast football in general.
As in many environments, this is a situation that is changing thanks to the perseverance of many women. They should have as much place as men in esports and play at a professional level.</description></item><item><title>What is Super Smash Bros.
